<?php
//PHP give us an operator for raising a number to the power of another number: the exponentiation operator (**).
//
//For example, we can square a number by raising it to the power of 2:
//
//echo 4 ** 2; // Prints: 16
//We can also use this operator on floats and negative numbers:
//
//echo 2.89 ** 3.2;  // Prints: 29.845104015297
//echo 10 ** -1; // Prints: 0.1
//For PHP to interpret this operator correctly it can’t have any spaces between the two * characters:
//
//echo 2 * * 3; // Will result in an error
//Let’s do some more math!
//
//Instructions
//1.
//Use echo and the exponent operator to print the value of 8 squared to the terminal.

echo 8**2;
